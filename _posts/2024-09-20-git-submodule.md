### Cheat Sheet: Setting Up and Managing a Shared Submodule Across Branches

#### **Purpose:**
You need to share specific files (`AI_assist/future_comments.txt`, `AI_assist/prompts.md`, `README.md`) across multiple branches (`master`, `working`, and potentially others in the future). Using a **Git submodule**, these files are maintained in a separate branch (`shared-files`), and the submodule is added to all relevant branches to ensure synchronization. This method allows edits in one branch to automatically reflect in all other branches that use the submodule.

---

### **Steps to Achieve the Setup Using Submodules**

#### 1. **Prepare the `shared-files` Branch**:
   - This branch will contain only the specific files that need to be shared across other branches.
   
   Steps:
   - Switch to the branch (e.g., `master`):
     ```bash
     git checkout master
     ```
   - Create the `shared-files` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b shared-files
     ```
   - Remove all unnecessary files from tracking:
     ```bash
     git rm -r --cached .
     ```
   - Add back only the files you need:
     ```bash
     git add AI_assist/future_comments.txt AI_assist/prompts.md README.md
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial commit of shared files"
     ```
   - Push the `shared-files` branch to the remote:
     ```bash
     git push -u origin shared-files
     ```

#### 2. **Add the `shared-files` Submodule to the `master` Branch**:

   - Switch to the `master` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout master
     ```
   - Remove the duplicate files from the `master` branch (if present):
     ```bash
     git rm AI_assist/future_comments.txt AI_assist/prompts.md README.md
     git commit -m "Remove duplicate files before adding submodule"
     ```
   - Add the `shared-files` branch as a submodule in the `master` branch:
     ```bash
     git submodule add -b shared-files https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git shared-files
     ```
     > **Note:** Replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git` with your repository URL.

   - Commit the submodule addition:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add shared-files as submodule in master"
     ```

#### 3. **Repeat the Same for the `working` Branch**:
   - Switch to the `working` branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout working
     ```
   - Remove the duplicate files from `working`:
     ```bash
     git rm AI_assist/future_comments.txt AI_assist/prompts.md README.md
     git commit -m "Remove duplicate files before adding submodule"
     ```
   - Add the submodule to the `working` branch:
     ```bash
     git submodule add -b shared-files https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git shared-files
     ```

   - **If you encounter a "submodule already exists" error**, use the `--force` option to reuse the existing submodule:
     ```bash
     git submodule add -b shared-files --force https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git shared-files
     ```
   - Commit the submodule addition:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add shared-files as submodule in working"
     ```

#### 4. **Sync Changes Across Branches**:
   - After committing changes to the `shared-files` submodule in any branch, you need to **sync** those changes in other branches.
   - To pull the latest changes in the submodule:
     ```bash
     git submodule update --remote
     ```

   - If any branch is ahead with local commits, push the changes:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```

---

### **Additional Considerations and Tricky Points**

1. **Handling Duplicate Files:**
   - If files already exist in the branch where you're adding the submodule, you **must remove them** using `git rm` before adding the submodule. Otherwise, you risk having duplicate files and conflict issues.

2. **Reusing an Existing Submodule (`--force` flag):**
   - If you encounter the error: 
     ```bash
     fatal: A git directory for 'shared-files' is found locally...
     ```
     This happens because Git detects that the submodule already exists locally. To reuse the existing directory, add the `--force` flag:
     ```bash
     git submodule add -b shared-files --force https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git shared-files
     ```

3. **Pushing Submodule Changes to Remote:**
   - After making changes in the submodule, remember to **push** the changes:
     ```bash
     git push origin shared-files
     ```
   - You also need to push the changes in the parent branch (e.g., `master`, `working`):
     ```bash
     git push origin master
     ```

4. **Removing Untracked Local Files:**
   - Even if files are removed from Git tracking (`git rm`), they will still exist in your working directory. You need to **manually delete** them from your system if you donâ€™t need them.

### **Commands Summary**:

- **Create a branch**:  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b shared-files
  ```

- **Remove files from tracking**:  
  ```bash
  git rm AI_assist/future_comments.txt AI_assist/prompts.md README.md
  ```

- **Add submodule**:  
  ```bash
  git submodule add -b shared-files https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git shared-files
  ```

- **Force reuse of existing submodule**:  
  ```bash
  git submodule add -b shared-files --force https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git shared-files
  ```

- **Update submodule**:  
  ```bash
  git submodule update --remote
  ```

- **Push changes**:  
  ```bash
  git push origin master
  git push origin shared-files
  ```

---

### **End Result**:
- You now have a submodule (`shared-files`) in `master`, `working`, and any future branches that can share the same files across branches.
- Changes made to these files in any branch will be automatically reflected in all other branches when you update the submodule.
