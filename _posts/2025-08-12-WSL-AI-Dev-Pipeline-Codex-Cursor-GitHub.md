Use this guide to set up an end‚Äëto‚Äëend WSL AI development pipeline that keeps your repositories in WSL for performance and makes Codex CLI fully functional, while you edit from Cursor on Windows and version in Git from WSL.

- Keep repos on WSL‚Äôs ext4 for speed and reliable tooling.
- Run Codex CLI in WSL; authenticate using the WSL workflow below.
- Open and edit the same repo from Cursor on Windows via Remote - WSL.
- Commit, branch, and push from WSL with SSH keys.
- Bonus: Codex + Cursor is a great combo; currently, OpenAI and Cursor are offering GPT‚Äë5 testing in both with separate usage limits.

**Target:** Ubuntu 22.04 in WSL2 ‚Äî this is the recommended default for Windows developers using Linux tooling in WSL **as of 2025**, because Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is widely supported, stable, and gets long-term updates. The instructions here assume this environment. If you‚Äôre using another distribution or release, some package commands or versions may differ, and future LTS releases may change the defaults.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Update apt and check Node.js/npm**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
node -v && npm -v  # Checks Node.js/npm versions, needs v20.x/v10.x or newer
```

If both Node.js and npm are new enough, you can skip the Node.js upgrade steps.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Remove old Node/npm if needed**

```bash
sudo apt remove -y nodejs npm libnode-dev
sudo apt autoremove -y
sudo apt clean
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Install latest Node.js LTS (if upgrade needed)**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs git

# Verify
node -v && npm -v  #  Node.js/npm versions, should be v20.x/v10.x or newer
```

**üí° Why the curl step is important:** Ubuntu‚Äôs default apt repository (even in 22.04 LTS) often ships older Node versions for stability. The `curl` command adds NodeSource‚Äôs repository to apt, which provides up-to-date Node.js builds. Without it, `apt install nodejs` would likely give you an outdated version (e.g., v12 on older setups), breaking modern tools like Codex CLI.

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Codex CLI**

```bash
sudo npm install -g @openai/codex
codex --version  # should show codex-cli 0.20.0 or similar
```
If npm prompts about a newer major version being available, you can usually **ignore it** unless you specifically need the newest npm features. NodeSource ships the npm version bundled with the Node LTS release, which is tested for stability. To update anyway:

```bash
sudo npm install -g npm@latest
```

This is optional and mainly for users who want the very latest npm.

### WSL authentication (headless browser) workaround

If `codex login` cannot open a browser inside WSL, use this SSH tunnel method from Windows. See the project notes about Windows/WSL in the Codex CLI repo: [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex).

1. Install and start SSH server in WSL (Ubuntu):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y openssh-server
   sudo service ssh start
   ```

2. From Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt, forward port 1455 to WSL and keep this window open:

   ```powershell
   ssh -L 1455:localhost:1455 your-wsl-username@localhost
   ```

3. In your WSL terminal, run login and follow the URL in your Windows browser:

   ```bash
   codex login
   # Auth server listens on http://localhost:1455 and prints an https://auth.openai.com/... URL
   ```

4.Click the URL with ctrl (or copy paste to browser) and complete auth in Windows browser. It should redirect to `http://localhost:1455/success`. The WSL terminal will show "Successfully logged in".

5. Verify and clean up:

   ```bash
   codex "print('Hello')"  # quick test
   ```

   - Close the Windows SSH tunnel window when done.
   - Optionally stop SSH in WSL: `sudo service ssh stop` (or remove `openssh-server` if no longer needed).

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Create SSH key for GitHub**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Press Enter for defaults, set a passphrase for safety

# Start ssh-agent automatically
echo 'eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Auto-load key on first Git use per session
cat << 'EOF' >> ~/.bashrc

# Auto-load SSH key when Git is first used
git() {
    ssh-add -l >/dev/null 2>&1 || ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    command git "$@"
}
EOF
source ~/.bashrc

# Show public key to add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

**‚Üí Copy & paste** into GitHub:
*Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key*

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure SSH for GitHub**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh
# The here‚Äëdoc below appends multiple lines non‚Äëinteractively, you can also paste the block between lines with EOF using nano.
cat << 'EOF' > ~/.ssh/config
Host *
    ForwardAgent no
    IdentitiesOnly yes

Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
EOF
```

```bash
# Set correct permissions for SSH config file (required for SSH to work)
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Clone repos into WSL filesystem**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YourUser/your-repo.git
```

### **Git + Codex SSH**

- **SSH passphrase in the same terminal**: Provide your SSH key passphrase in the same terminal where you plan to run `codex`. The `codex` CLI cannot prompt for the SSH key passphrase itself (tested in codex-cli 0.20.0). Trigger the prompt first with a harmless Git command, for example:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

- **Set remote manually (SSH)**: If you configure the Git remote yourself, use the SSH URL:

  ```bash
  git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
  ```

- **Letting codex init Git**: If you let `codex` initialize and configure Git, supply an SSH URL (not HTTPS), for example:

  ```text
  git@github.com:user/git-remote-test.git
  ```

‚úÖ Keeps everything on ext4 for speed and avoids CRLF issues.

---

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Use VS Code/Cursor in WSL mode**

- Install **Remote - WSL** extension.
- From WSL terminal:

  ```bash
  code ~/projects/your-repo
  ```

  *(Replace `code` with `cursor` if available)*
- Status bar should show: **\[WSL: Ubuntu]**

---

## **üìÖ First-use checklist after reboot**

```bash
# 1. Open WSL terminal (ssh-agent starts automatically from .bashrc)
# 2. Run any git command (first use will prompt for passphrase)
#    Tip: Do this in the same terminal where you'll run `codex`, e.g.:
#    git status
#    (codex cannot prompt for SSH key passphrase itself)
```

After that, GitHub SSH will work without asking again until you close WSL or reboot.

---

Now you‚Äôve got:

- Latest Node.js + npm
- Codex CLI
- Fast, secure GitHub SSH access with 1 passphrase per session
- Projects on WSL‚Äôs native filesystem
- Seamless IDE integration
